## The Repository

This repository serves as a base reference to assist users and teams in setting up a new
repository, which can be selected while creating a new repository, with the directory
structure, branches and files same as here for any open-source software (OSS) project
created in Volvo Cars.

> ⚠ _Any code that Volvo Cars does not own the copyright or has not received under
> Volvo's Contributor License Agreement (CLA) must be placed in a `third_party`
> directory at the root of the project._

Get the project owner involved right from the beginning of the project until making the
repo visibility to `public`.
